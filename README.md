## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- Poetry 2.2.1 or higher (for development)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ctasada/stonks-overwatch.git
   cd stonks-overwatch
   ```

2. **Configure your brokers** (optional, can be done later)

   ```bash
   cp config/config.json.template config/config.json
   # Edit config.json with your broker credentials
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and start the application**

   ```bash
   make start
   ```

   This command will:
   - Install all Python and Node.js dependencies
   - Initialize the database
   - Collect static files
   - Start the development server

   The application will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

> **Alternative**: If you prefer step-by-step setup, you can run `make install` first, then `make collectstatic migrate`, and finally `make run`. However, `make start` handles all of this automatically.

For detailed installation instructions, see the [Quickstart Guide](docs/Quickstart.md).

## ❤️ Why Sponsor Me?

Hi, I'm Carlos—the creator and maintainer of Stonks Overwatch. Let me share why I built this project and why your support matters.

### The Story Behind Stonks Overwatch

Like many investors, I found myself juggling multiple broker accounts—DEGIRO for stocks, Bitvavo for crypto, IBKR for international markets. Each broker had its own interface, its own way of presenting data, and none of them gave me the unified view I needed to truly understand my portfolio.

The commercial alternatives? They either charged monthly fees I couldn't justify, collected and sold my financial data, or required me to trust third-party cloud services with my most sensitive information. That didn't sit right with me.

So I built Stonks Overwatch—a privacy-first, open-source solution that runs entirely on your machine. Your data never leaves your computer. No subscriptions. No data selling. Just honest, transparent portfolio tracking.

### The Reality of Maintaining This Project

**Time Investment:** I spend a lot of my free time over the last year to build an improve Stonks Overwatch:
- Fixing bugs and responding to issues
- Improving the UI/UX based on feedback
- Writing documentation and guides
- Building native desktop applications for all platforms

**What I've Built So Far:**
- ✅ Full integration with DEGIRO (real-time data)
- ✅ Beta support for Bitvavo and IBKR
- ✅ Native desktop apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ✅ Comprehensive portfolio analytics and visualization
- ✅ Dividend tracking and forecasting
- ✅ Fee analysis across all brokers
- ✅ Complete documentation and developer guides
- ✅ Plugin architecture design (ready for implementation)

**What's Coming Next:**
- 🚀 Dynamic plugin system for easy broker additions
- 📱 Mobile app support (iOS and Android)
- 📊 Advanced analytics and reporting
- 🔌 Community-driven broker plugins
- 🌍 Support for more international brokers
- ⚡ Performance optimizations and caching improvements

### What Sponsorship Enables

Your sponsorship directly enables me to:

1. **Dedicate More Time** - Currently, I work on this in evenings and weekends. Sponsorship would allow me to allocate more focused development time.

2. **Faster Broker Integrations** - Each new broker integration requires significant research, API exploration, testing, and documentation. Sponsorship helps prioritize these features.

3. **Better Infrastructure** - Covering costs for CI/CD, testing infrastructure, code signing certificates for native apps, and hosting for documentation.

4. **Community Growth** - Supporting community initiatives, hackathons, and contributor recognition programs.

5. **Long-term Sustainability** - Ensuring Stonks Overwatch remains free, open-source, and privacy-focused for years to come.

### Your Support Makes a Difference

- A casual investor who found value in the tool
- A developer who appreciates the clean architecture
- Someone who believes in privacy-first software
- A company using Stonks Overwatch internally
