# Stonks Overwatch

**Stonks Overwatch** is a new Open Source Stocks Dashboard.

Why do we need yet another dashboard? I have been a DEGIRO user for many years, and the more active I was,
the more frustrated I became with the lack of any decent dashboard to overview my investments.

After trying different options (I will omit names), I couldn't find any that was really covering my needs, or
that I could trust.

Stonks Overwatch runs locally and doesn't share your data with anyone. Your data is yours.

## What does offer **Stonks Overwatch**?

**Stonks Overwatch** is born with the intention to provide a usable investment dashboard for DEGIRO, but with the desire
to keep growing to provide many more features in the future.

Right now the features we offer are:

* Realtime access to your DEGIRO investments
* Portfolio value overtime
* Portfolio growth
* Dividends overview
* Fees overview
* Deposits overview
* Diversification overview
* Transactions
* Account Statements
