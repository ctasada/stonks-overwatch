# User Interface

The user interface of **Stonks Overwatch** is build with the next technologies:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) for the CSS framework
- [Bootstrap Table](https://bootstrap-table.com/) for the tables
- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) for the icons
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for additional icons
- [Charts.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for the charts

The code for the user interface is located in the `src/stonks_overwatch/templates` directory.
The templates are written in HTML and use the Jinja2 templating engine to render dynamic content.

The needed static files (CSS, JS, images) are located in the `src/stonks_overwatch/static` directory.
