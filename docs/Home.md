# Stonks Overwatch

**Stonks Overwatch** is a new Open Source Stocks Dashboard.

Why do we need yet another dashboard? I have been a DEGIRO user for many years, and the more active I was,
the more frustrated I became with the lack of any decent dashboard to overview my investments.

After trying different options (I will omit names), I couldn't find any that was really covering my needs, or
that I could trust.

Stonks Overwatch runs locally and doesn't share your data with anyone. Your data is yours.

## What does offer **Stonks Overwatch**?
